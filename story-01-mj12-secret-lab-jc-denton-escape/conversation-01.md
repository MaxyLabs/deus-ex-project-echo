# Conversations Among Coworkers

Below is some dialogue that reflects suspicion while keeping the coworkers on a misguided track:

**Scene: Lab Breakroom**

Two low-level lab technicians, Dana and Marcus, are talking over coffee in the breakroom. Dana is glancing at her tablet nervously while Marcus leans against the counter, sipping from a mug.

**Dana:** [Whispering] “I’m telling you, Marcus, something doesn’t feel right about that new shipment.”
**Marcus:** “You mean the one we had to unload in the middle of the night? Welcome to the graveyard shift. Weird schedules come with the territory.”
**Dana:** [Leaning in] “It wasn’t just the time. I caught a glimpse of the manifest—it listed ‘biosynthetic materials’ but didn’t specify the source. That’s not standard protocol.”
**Marcus:** [Smirking] “Relax, Dana. It's probably just classified. Half the time we don’t even know what we’re working on.”
**Dana:** [Hushed] “And what about the reinforced freight? Looked like a coffin with all those locks. What if it’s…you know, biological warfare? Or some rogue nation’s tech?”
**Marcus:* [Chuckling] “You’ve been watching too many spy dramas. If anything, it’s probably just another project outsourced from the Chinese Ministry of Defense. You know how cozy they are with our execs.”

**Scene: Maintenance Tunnel**

Maintenance engineers Sam and Oliver are doing routine checks in the dimly lit tunnel connecting the lab to the surface. The sound of fans and distant humming machines fills the air.

**Sam:** “You notice how they’ve upped the security down here lately? New cameras, patrol drones. Like they’re expecting something.”
**Oliver:** “Yeah, and that’s not all. Last week, I saw a couple of suits walking around with those augmented agents. You know, the ones with the creepy eyes?”
**Sam:** “MJ12? Damn, you think they’re sniffing around because of that incident in Paris? Heard UNATCO got sloppy over there.”
**Oliver:** [Shrugs] “Could be. But if you ask me, it’s the Russians. Heard a rumor they’ve been running black ops in our sector. Maybe our bosses are prepping for a counter-op.”
**Sam:** “Makes sense. Though, I’d sleep easier if they weren’t so damn secretive. Feels like we’re the only ones in the dark down here.”
