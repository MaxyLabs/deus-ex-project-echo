# Notes

**Purpose of These Conversations**

- **Tension Building:** These snippets add realism and keep the story grounded in Deus Exâ€™s world of suspicion, conspiracy, and misdirection.  
- **Foreshadowing:** The dialogue hints at strange happenings (e.g., mysterious shipments and augmented agents) without revealing the true nature of the lab.  
- **World-Building:** The references to other nations, organizations, and locations tie into the global intrigue that defines Deus Ex.
