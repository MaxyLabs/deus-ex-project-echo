Below is some dialogue that reflects suspicion while keeping the coworkers on a misguided track:

**Scene: Lab Breakroom**

Two low-level lab technicians, Dana and Marcus, are talking over coffee in the breakroom. Dana is glancing at her tablet nervously while Marcus leans against the counter, sipping from a mug.

- **Dana:** [Whispering] “I’m telling you, Marcus, something doesn’t feel right about that new shipment.”  
- **Marcus:** “You mean the one we had to unload in the middle of the night? Welcome to the graveyard shift. Weird schedules come with the territory.”  
- **Dana:** [Leaning in] “It wasn’t just the time. I caught a glimpse of the manifest—it listed ‘biosynthetic materials’ but didn’t specify the source. That’s not standard protocol.”  
- **Marcus:** [Smirking] “Relax, Dana. It's probably just classified. Half the time we don’t even know what we’re working on.”  
- **Dana:** [Hushed] “And what about the reinforced freight? Looked like a coffin with all those locks. What if it’s... you know, biological warfare? Or some rogue nation’s tech?”  
- **Marcus:** [Chuckling] “You’ve been watching too many spy dramas. If anything, it’s probably just another project outsourced from the Chinese Ministry of Defense. You know how cozy they are with our execs.”
