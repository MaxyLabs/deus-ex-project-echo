**Scene: Maintenance Tunnel**

Maintenance engineers Sam and Oliver are doing routine checks in the dimly lit tunnel connecting the lab to the surface. The sound of fans and distant humming machines fills the air.  

**Sam:** “You notice how they’ve upped the security down here lately? New cameras, patrol drones. Like they’re expecting something.”  

**Oliver:** “Yeah, and that’s not all. Last week, I saw a couple of suits walking around with those augmented agents. You know, the ones with the creepy eyes?”  

**Sam:** “MJ12? Damn, you think they’re sniffing around because of that incident in Paris? Heard UNATCO got sloppy over there.”  

**Oliver:** [Shrugs] “Could be. But if you ask me, it’s the Russians. Heard a rumor they’ve been running black ops in our sector. Maybe our bosses are prepping for a counter-op.”  

**Sam:** “Makes sense. Though, I’d sleep easier if they weren’t so damn secretive. Feels like we’re the only ones in the dark down here.”
