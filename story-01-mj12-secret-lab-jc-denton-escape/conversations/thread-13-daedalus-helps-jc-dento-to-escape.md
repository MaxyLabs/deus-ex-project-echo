**How Daedalus Helps JC Escape**

1. Background of the Escape:
    - After JC is captured, MJ12 imprisons him in their labs to interrogate him and study his nano-augmentations.
    - During this time, Daedalus, having already defected from MJ12, contacts JC through his infolink. The AI identifies JC as a valuable ally in its fight against MJ12’s authoritarian agenda.

2. Providing Guidance:
    - Daedalus gives JC instructions on how to disable the security measures and escape from his cell. This includes directing him to find keycodes, access terminals, and avoid or neutralize MJ12 guards.
    - It also provides information about the layout of the facility and tips on how to retrieve JC’s confiscated weapons and augmentations.

3. Revealing MJ12’s Operations:
    - As part of the escape, Daedalus reveals crucial information about MJ12’s plans, further aligning JC with the resistance against their global conspiracy.
    - This interaction strengthens JC’s alliance with anti-MJ12 factions, positioning him as a key figure in the fight against their oppressive regime.

**Why Not Helios?**

At this stage in the story, Helios is still under the control of MJ12 and is being developed as their ultimate AI. Helios' role becomes more prominent later in the narrative, where it emerges as a potential antagonist or ally, depending on JC’s choices.  

Daedalus, being a rogue AI, is the one that actively opposes MJ12 and aids JC Denton during his escape.
