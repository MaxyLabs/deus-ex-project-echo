**Plot Overview**
1. A New Perspective:
    - The protagonist is a test subject in the same lab, a beta version of the nano-augmentation program (e.g., "Project Echo").
    - Unlike JC, their augmentations are unstable, causing unpredictable abilities but severe side effects.

2. The Catalyst:
    - During JC’s escape, chaos erupts in the lab, providing the perfect opportunity for the protagonist to break free.
    - The protagonist initially helps JC indirectly by sabotaging security systems or drawing MJ12 forces away.

3. Choices and Consequences:
    - The protagonist uncovers classified files hinting at other experiments and cover-ups by MJ12.
    - They must decide whether to escape quietly, rescue other test subjects, or confront the facility’s director.

4. Climactic Showdown:
    - As JC disables the lab’s central systems, the protagonist confronts their own handler—an MJ12 operative conflicted about the project’s ethics.
    - The ending could branch based on player choices: escape alone, save others, or destroy the lab entirely.
